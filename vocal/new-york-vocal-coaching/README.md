    2. Breathing - taking too much air, using too much air, solar plexus (ep 52)
    3. Larynx - should not be the primary pitch changer (do not raise larynx!) but rather used for styling
    4. Alignment - be aware of lower back arching and sternum slumping
    5. Vocal Cords - squeezed vs clean vs aspirate
    6. Jaw & Tongue - use ng positions
    7. Soul - don't strain it! Learn to say "it is well"
